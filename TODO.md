## Short term

1. Continue implemeneting FilesInterface with the filter, compress and archive
    tasks.

1. Then come up with a way to navigate the logs. Need to read individual logs.
    Do this via a CLI interface. Also the digest log.
    Then the hourly summary log (proto+human), and the daily summar log (just human readable?)
1. Do do the latter, need to clean up the proto file.
    Also split the unittests proto code off (and use it?)

1. The usual PEP 8 + code nicifying
